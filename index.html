  <h1>Create a Pluriverse Data Journal Entry</h1>
  by Danielle Gauthier<br>
  <br>
  1. Answer the "Pluriverse Data Journal Problems" for moving forward in the boxes below. <br><br>
  (If you are grieving, please don't think I mean forgetting anyone. I mean remembering.)<br><br>
  2. Find out how common your answers are and why.<br>
  <li>race</li>
  <li>gender</li>
  <li>education</li>
  <li>occupation</li>
  <li>wealth</li>
  <li>ability/health</li>
  <li>geography</li>
  <br><br>
  a. How are you an outlier? What is your experience attached to this?<br>
  b. How are you average? Is it a structural flaw? Is it an anthropological reflection of your culture?<br>
  c. What do your people need? Who do you relate to the most and how can you be supported better by us?<br>
  For help with part 2c, imaging the future, answer the "design" questions. This will determine the formatting of your Pluriverse Data Journal Entry.
  <br><br>
  3. Hit Enter and you will get results.
